My AI-related technology exercise and test

Implement model to better understanding theory,and test and compare different model's efficiency,tracking loss and accuracy change,find way to optimize.

It's contain : 
  1. Reinforcement learn : Duel DQN
  2. unsupervise learn : SiameseModel
  3. supervise learn : VGG19(pretrain),VGG16(pretrain),Custom CNN Model
  4. K-means-cluster,K-nearist-neighbors,decision tree...

if you see something wrong in my code,please tell me thx you.
